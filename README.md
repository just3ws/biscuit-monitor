CINR

CINR stands for Carrier to Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (CINR), expressed in decibels (dBs). CINR is a measurement of signal effectiveness. We use the CINR score to tell us the signal quality received by the modem.

The higher the number the better signal quality you are receiving. You need at minimum a CINR of 8 or greater to receive consistent service. A CINR score of 18 or higher is considered excellent signal quality.

RSSI

RSSI stands for Received signal strength indicator RSSI is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. We use RSSI score to tell us the strength of signal your CLEAR Spot is receiving.

A RSSI score of -100dBm reflects poor signal strength, a score of -50dBm is an excellent RSSI score and reflects a strong signal.
